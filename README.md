# Description 

This is a Jupyter Notebook file to calculate the 3 most popular Word Embedding-based metrics to evaluate a generative conversational chatbot's answering performance for dialogue texts. 

The 3 metrics implemented: 
* #### Greedy Matching score, the cosine similarity matching between the 300d vectors of the reference answer and the chatbot's answer
* #### Embedding average score, average cosine similarity between vectors
* #### Vector Extrema score, min and max score of cosine similarity

# Example Usage:  
(see "EMBEDDING_METRICS_TEST_EXAMPLE")
